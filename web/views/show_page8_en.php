&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Internet technology becomes more advanced, the number of consumers who prefer to shop online for foreign merchandise is on the rise. This kind of online shopping is called HaiTao in Chinese. In 2014, Dindin established a platform (www.dindin.com) to provide a safe, convenient and efficient online shopping platform which is able to help consumers handle customs and logistics problems. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are almost a hundred types of merchandise on www.dindin.com, most of them being maternity items, health products and skincare products. These products have all passed quality checks in foreign countries and are safe to use as well as much cheaper compared to those sold in stores. For certain merchandise such as skincare products, cosmetics and electronic gadgets, consumers can get them earlier on HaiTao, not to mention at a much lower price.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dindin is placed strategically close to Hong Kong, and has a branch in America, the world’s largest exporter. In the process of expanding, Dindin has received many foreign e-merchants, and it runs on a warehouse-to-consumer direct sales model, which helps reduce costs drastically. Besides that, cross-border e-commerce is highly supported and encouraged by the government. As such, Dindin receives immense support from the City Hall, SAFE and industry players. With the standardization of cross-border e-commerce, the rise of Dindin seems unstoppable.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2015, Dindin officially recruits merchants from all over the globe. We sincerely hope that more merchants will share our aspirations and join us. Thank you very much for your interest in Dindin. If you have any suitable suggestions for collaboration, please contact us.
