	 Personal items shipped from overseas must adhere to the Chinese customs regulations. Shipped personal items should be for personal use only, in reasonable quantities, and declared accordingly. The principles for personal itemsmailed are: convenient, reasonable, and anti-smuggling. Based on these principles, the customs regulate the maximum value, duty-free price and limit the types of items couriered. The customs will inspect the shipped items accordingly, and may or may not collect duty, depending on thediscretion of the customs. Therefore, the quantity should be reasonable, and only for personal use. The reasonable amount depends on the exact situation. The customs clearance procedure is as follows:<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp; 	 For shipped personal items within RMB 1000 (If the item cannot be dismantled, it can exceed RMB 1000, for example laptops), the duty rate will occur. If the duty is less than RMB 50 then the item is duty-free. Otherwise, duty will be collected.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;   If the customs decides that the package does not qualify as a personal item, the package will be transferred to trade declaration. The customs will return goods prohibited from import, and require the consignor to pay the corresponding logistics costs.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;     Usually, the customs clearance fees and other related fees except the duty rate is borne by the international courier company. If duty issues arise, the buyer and the merchant should negotiate accordingly.<br>
